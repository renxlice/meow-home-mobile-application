Dzikir Program: A dedicated section to perform and manage daily dzikir activities seamlessly.

Multi-Operation Calculator: A powerful calculator capable of handling various mathematical operations, providing accuracy and ease of use.

Dynamic Gallery: A gallery feature that fetches random images from an API, offering a fresh and engaging visual experience every time.

Contact Retrieval: A contact section that fetches random contact data from an API, showcasing integration with external data sources.

Secure Authentication: Robust security protocols requiring users to log in or register before accessing the app, ensuring data protection and privacy. Admins can also view all registered accounts in the Save Data View for effective management.

User Guide: A built-in user guide offering clear and concise instructions for navigating and utilizing the app's features.

Location Services: A location feature that allows users to search for nearby hotels or tourist attractions, providing valuable convenience for travel planning.
